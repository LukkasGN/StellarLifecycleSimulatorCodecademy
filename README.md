# 🌟 Stellar Lifecycle Simulator

A simple C# console app that models the lifecycle of stars using a custom `Star` class. Designed as a practice project for object-oriented programming with constructors, method behavior, and simulation.

## 🚀 Features

- Track star properties: `name`, `type`, `age`, `brightness`
- Simulate aging and brightness decay
- Handle supernova explosions

## 🛠 Usage

```bash
dotnet run
```

## 📄 Sample Output

Star Sirius is shining with brightness 1.
Star Sirius is shining with brightness 0.9.
Star type set to default: Unknown.
Star X-101 is shining with brightness 1.
Star X-101 is shining with brightness 0.9.
Star X-101 has exploded in a supernova.
Star X-101 is shining with brightness 0.
